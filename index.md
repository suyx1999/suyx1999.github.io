## About Me

Hi, my name is Yunxiang Su (苏云祥). I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the [School of Software](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) of Tsinghua University, advised by Professor [Shaoxu Song](https://sxsong.github.io). I receivced my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Physics from the [Department of Physics](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University.

My research primarily focuses on **AI + Data**. In **Data for AI**, I worked on database-native machine learning that leverages intrinsic database capabilities to accelerate learning efficiency. I develop native machine learning algorithms for the open-source time-series database [Apache IoTDB](https://iotdb.apache.org).

In **AI for Data**, I am currently exploring LLM-powered database management systems and data agents, aiming to deeply integrate the capabilities of LLMs into databases. I am now interning in the Intelligent System Group at Alibaba’s Tongyi Lab, advised by [Rong Zhu](https://redgitcard.github.io/redgitcard/).
